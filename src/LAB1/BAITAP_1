Construct a Rectangle class with two Attributes : width and length, along with the methods getPerimeter() and getArea()
to Calculate the perimeter and area. The display() method will output the length, area and perimeter to the screen

Create a Square class that inherits from the Rectangle class and overrides the display() method to output the side length, area, and perimeter.

Write a program to input two rectangles and one square, then display their information on the screen.

Guidance
✔ Build the classes following the inheritance hierarchy as described.
